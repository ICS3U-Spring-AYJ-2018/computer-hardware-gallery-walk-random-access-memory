# Things I learned

I have learned many things during my time spent working on this project. I've learned skills I will be able to use in the future.
I learned a lot about HTML5 and coding within it, things like lists, images, tables, and some other stuff. Along with that I learned about
CSS, and how to add fun colours, cool fonts, and other things. I also learned about troubleshooting issues and how to find new and
intuitive ways to fix my problems. Along with all the coding stuff, I learned about the more detailed functions of RAM. Things like how it
works, how it's used, what preceded it, and how it stores its data.

I also learned a lot about number systems. I learned about how finite fields work, how they're applied in systems, etc. I also learned
about how even though a lot of number systems are similar, they also have many differences. Systems like binary, hexadecimal, and octal,
and how at the base they're all quite similar but also have differences and how they are used in some systems. Encoding systems I learned
such as ASCII and UNICODE and how they are used to display text we can recognise through a different type of code that they use.

# Things I still want to learn

I would really like to learn more about the physical functions of a computer and how to build one manually using all the required parts.
things like cpu cooling via fans or liquid-cooling, single or SLI gpu usage and how they connect to create more power. Learning how to
know what might use too much power or create errors in the system and why that occurs, and how solutions can be found and applied to the
problems.
