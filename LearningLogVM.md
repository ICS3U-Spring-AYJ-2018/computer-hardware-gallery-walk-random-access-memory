# Things I learned
(1-2 pragraphs)

I have learned a number of things thoroughtout this marvelous project. I learned how to do new tings with HTML5 and CSS. I learned how to link different speread sheets with html5. I learned a bit about JavaScript. I also learned about the workflow that is Github. I learned how to push, pull and use it in an effective manner to complete the task. Aswell as how to clone my project with github and how effective version control can be when using Github. I also learned how to use Atom with github and how to use teletype, to work with multiple people at once in Atom. I also learned how to use Markdown, to help make this file and along with the README. This task also helped develop my cooperation skills by working with other people in this project. 
  
I learnt a great deal about number systems throughout this project. I learned how to use binary, hexadecimal, octal, unicode and ASCII. I learned how to add basic numbers in binary and finite fields. I found it very interesting. Another thing I learned is the processus of how a program runs and how it relates to binary. Throughout the gallery walk, I learned about different hardwares and how they connect to the computer part, their purpose and how number systems relates to it. For examples, I learned how SSD is stored in binary and how it is a permant storage unlike the hardware I was reaseaching, RAM. 

# Things I still want to learn
(1-2 paragraphs)

Some things I would still like to learn is how to make atom use github. Throughout this assignment I have been using the github bash, rather than using atom's built in github feature. I also feel like if I were to learn other languages such as JavaScript and if I were be able to apply them to the website. I feel that learning JavaScript will enhance our overall feel of the website. I would also like to learn better coding practices, such as doing branching, or even formatting in HTML5 and CSS.
