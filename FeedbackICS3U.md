## Learning Goals and Success Criteria

The [Overarching Learning Goal(s)](./images/ICS3U.jpg) for this include _Computational Analysis and Design_.
The specific Learning Goal(s) for this include:
  * We are learning to work with computer components and organize data. 

| Success Criteria  | Learning and Improvement Comments |
| ----------- | ------- |
| I can use correct terminology related to computer specifications | There is a clear understanding demonstrated in this project but in the future you should strive to make subtle connections between finite fields and all processes. At its basic level fields are all finite and computers demonstrate the properties of these fields very explicitly.|
| I can communicate the purpose of individual computer components relating to executing program operations | This information was collected and shared. Picking out precise groups of application types and relating it with how certain devices used them with regards to efficiency could have allowed for improved purpose when caryying out this task.|
| I can relate computer component and peripheral specifications to user requirements | The layout of the webpage allows for further and richer relating to user requirements. In future one could extend this site to make it clear about how different groups of users make use of certain types of components.|
