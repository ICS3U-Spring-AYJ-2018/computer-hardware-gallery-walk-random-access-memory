# Things I Learned

There are numerous things that I learned throughout this assignment. My most important takeaway from this project was learning how to code in HTML5 and CSS from scratch, as well as using Git and GitHub to version control while collaborating. I learned about a small sample of JavaScript and about relating it to HTML code. I also learned about Atom and its functions, and used its packages to code more efficiently, including Teletype for collaboration and HTML Previewer to test the website without pushing. Finally, I learned more about using the Markdown syntax to create the readme file.

Information-wise, I learned about the many number systems and how they are related to computers. This includes finite fields, hexadecimals and octals. Through the gallery walk, I learned about the history of several computer components and how they are related to number systems.

# Things I Still Want to Learn

Some things I still want to learn include other programming languages, such as JavaScript, as they can be applied to the website. I also would like to learn better code practices, as we faced some difficulties trying to fix the layout and make the site more responsive. While I already know of branching in Git, I would like to use it next time to clean up the master branch.
